# PurchaseRequestSystem
Capstone Project for 2017 Spring Java Bootcamp

This objective of this project is to create an intranet site that an employee can use to purchase items. It will allow for user 
registration, purchase requests to be submitted, manager approval of purchase requests, and searching of products and vendors. 
The project will encompass Java, SQL, HTML, CSS, Javascript, and JSP/Servlets. 

Eclipse Neon and MySQL Workbench 6.3 were used. Available files include the Java src files as well as two SQL script files for database
formation, including the addition of products and vendors.
